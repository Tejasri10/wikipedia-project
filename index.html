          <p class="card-text"><b>Edward Dando (c. 1803 – 1832)</b> was a thief who overate at food stalls and inns, then revealed that he had no money to pay. He was particularly fond of oysters, once eating 300 in a sitting (cartoon pictured). Dando began his thefts in about 1826 and was arrested at least as early as 1828. Most of his activity was in London or Kent. He would often leave a house of correction, go on an eating spree the same day, be arrested straight away, and be put back in prison. He was put in solitary confinement at least once after he stole the rations of fellow prisoners. In August 1832, Dando caught cholera in prison and died. His death, like his exploits, was widely and sympathetically reported in the press. His name entered the public argot as a term for one who eats excessively and does not pay. He was the subject of numerous poems and ballads. William Makepeace Thackeray wrote a short story loosely based on Dando, which was made into a play.Dando began his thefts in about 1826 and was arrested at least as early as 1828.

          <p class="card-text"><b>Robert Earl Kaske (June 1, 1921 – August 8, 1989)</b> was an American professor of medieval literature. He spent most of his career at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he was the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities, and where he founded one of the preeminent medieval studies graduate programs in North America. His published output included lengthy interpretations of Beowulf, and of poems and passages by Dante and Chaucer, and frequently constituted leading studies. Kaske particularly enjoyed solving cruxes, with articles on problematic passages in works such as Pearl, Piers Plowman, the Divine Comedy, The Husband's Message, The Descent into Hell, and Beowulf.</p>

           <p> Born in Cincinnati and a straight-A student in high school, Kaske studied liberal arts at Xavier University and joined a variety of student literary organizations there. He was a four-year member of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, and was commissioned a second lieutenant before his 1942 graduation; much of the next four years was spent with the Army in the South Pacific during World War II. While there he read a story about a dusk-to-dawn conversation between two professors and, entranced by the prospect of such intellectual discussions, decided on an academic career. Kaske enrolled in the English literature program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) on the back of the G.I. Bill, received his master's in 1947, and his PhD in 1950.</p>

          <p class="card-text">On 31 August 2023 at around 01:30 SAST, a fire engulfed a hijacked building in Johannesburg, South Africa; 77 people were killed and 88 others were injured. It was one of the deadliest fires in South African history.</p>
          <p>The fire occurred in the Central Business District at a five-storey abandoned building that is owned by the city government and taken over by gangs on the corner of Delvers and Albert Streets.It was being illegally occupied by as many as 400 impoverished people — many of them foreign nationals, economic migrants, and asylum seekers — all of whom were being charged rent by the gangs.The fire broke out in the early hours of the morning on 31 August 2023, and the cause of the fire is not currently known. It spread through the building, trapping many people due to flimsy partitions and gates between makeshift rooms constructed by residents.Many residents jumped from the windows of the building to escape, some of whom did not survive the jump.Firefighters found bodies piled up where they had died at a locked gate on the ground floor while trying to exit the burning building.</p>
